# Product Context: LegalAI

## Why This Project Exists

LegalAI addresses a critical societal problem: the legal services gap. Millions of people worldwide face legal issues but cannot access professional legal help due to cost, availability, or other barriers. This tool democratizes legal knowledge by making it accessible, affordable, and immediate.

## Problems It Solves

### 1. Cost Barrier
- Traditional legal services are expensive
- Many people cannot afford attorney fees
- LegalAI provides affordable (or free) access to legal information

### 2. Access Barrier
- Legal services often require appointments
- Limited availability in many areas
- Language barriers
- LegalAI is available 24/7, anywhere with internet

### 3. Knowledge Barrier
- Legal language is complex and intimidating
- People don't know their rights
- Unclear what documents they need
- LegalAI uses plain language and guides users

### 4. Time Barrier
- Legal processes are slow
- People need immediate information
- LegalAI provides instant analysis and document generation

## How It Should Work

### User Journey: Legal Rights Analysis

1. **User arrives** at the platform
2. **Describes situation** in plain language (e.g., "My landlord is trying to evict me without notice")
3. **AI analyzes** the situation and identifies relevant legal rights
4. **User receives** comprehensive information including:
   - Their legal rights
   - Available options
   - Recommended actions
   - Warnings
   - Next steps
5. **User can** take action based on the information provided

### User Journey: Document Generation

1. **User selects** document type from available options
2. **Provides details** about what they need in the document
3. **AI generates** professional document tailored to their needs

5. **User downloads** the document for use
6. **User is advised** to review with legal counsel if needed
