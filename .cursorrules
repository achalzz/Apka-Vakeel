# LegalAI Project Rules

## Project Overview
LegalAI is an AI-powered legal rights awareness and document generation tool. It helps individuals understand their legal rights and generate professional legal documents.

## Key Principles

### 1. Accessibility First
- Use plain language, avoid legal jargon in UI
- Make the tool usable by non-lawyers
- Clear, simple interface
- Mobile-responsive design

### 2. Legal Accuracy
- Always include appropriate disclaimers
- Never claim to replace professional legal counsel
- Be clear about limitations
- Provide accurate information

### 3. User Experience
- Fast loading times
- Clear feedback (loading, success, error states)
- Intuitive navigation
- Helpful guidance at each step

### 4. Code Quality
- Use functional React components with hooks
- Follow service layer pattern for API calls
- Keep components focused and reusable
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Include error handling for all async operations

## File Structure Patterns

### Components
- Place reusable components in `src/components/`
- Use PascalCase for component files
- Keep components focused on single responsibility

### Pages
- Place page components in `src/pages/`
- Each route should have its own page component
- Pages compose components and handle page-level state

### Services
- Place API/service logic in `src/services/`
- Services handle all external API calls
- Keep business logic in services, not components
- Use async/await pattern

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Custom component classes defined in `index.css`
- Use color system from `tailwind.config.js`
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography

## Code Patterns

### State Management
- Use useState for component-level state
- Use local state, not global state (unless needed)
- Consider Context API for shared state if needed

### Async Operations
```javascript
const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
  setLoading(true)
  setError(null)
  try {
    const result = await service.call()
    setResult(result)
  } catch (err) {
    setError(err.message)
  } finally {
    setLoading(false)
  }
}
```

### Error Handling
- Always wrap async operations in try-catch
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Log errors for debugging (in development)

### Loading States
- Show loading indicator during async operations
- Disable form inputs while loading
- Use consistent loading UI patterns

## AI Integration

### Current: Mock Services
- Services in `src/services/` use mock data
- Simulate API delays for realistic UX
- Ready to replace with real API calls

### Future: Real AI Integration
- Update services to call actual AI APIs
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Implement proper prompt engineering
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Consider rate limiting

## Document Generation

### Supported Types
- Contracts, Letters, NDAs, Wills, Power of Attorney
- Lease Agreements, Employment Contracts, Invoices
- Cease and Desist, Complaints, Settlements, Partnerships

### Pattern
- User selects document type
- Provides details
- Service generates document
- User can preview and download

## Legal Disclaimers

### Always Include
- Informational purposes only
- Not legal advice
- Consult attorney for complex matters
- Review documents before use
- Laws vary by jurisdiction

## Testing Considerations

### Manual Testing
- Test all document types
- Test with various legal scenarios
- Verify error handling
- Check mobile responsiveness

### Future Automated Testing
- Unit tests for services
- Component tests
- Integration tests
- E2E tests

## Deployment

### Development
- Run with `npm run dev`
- Uses Vite dev server
- Hot module replacement enabled

### Production
- Build with `npm run build`
- Deploy static files to hosting
- Configure environment variables
- Use HTTPS in production

## Important Notes

- Never expose API keys in frontend code
- Always validate user input
- Include appropriate legal disclaimers
- Keep user data secure (if storing)
- Follow accessibility best practices
- Optimize for performance

## Future Enhancements

- User authentication
- Document editing
- PDF/DOCX export
- Multi-language support
- Chat interface
- Payment/subscription system
